For extra modifications of the Sheep Rescue game I implemented the following:
  - Added hearts whenever a sheep is hit by hay.
  - Added sounds for:
      - A sheep getting hit by hay.
      - Hay machine shooting hay.
      - A sheep falling.
  - Implemented an interface to keep track of the player score, by showing how many sheeps they have saved and how many sheeps have fallen.
  - Implemented an end of the game.
  - Added a title screen where you can press the buttons for "Play" and "Quit".
  
However, I noticed that whenever a sheep falls, it counts as two sheeps falling. I tried to debug the game to fix this, but I have not been able
to identify the error.
